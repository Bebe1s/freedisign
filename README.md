This is a completely free open source digital signage solution. This project uses SSH to connect to a pi download media from a github repo then play it using built in VLC player.

Currently the project supports .mp4 files but websites are in the prosses of being supported.

**DIRECTIONS:**

Create a github account (Skip this step if you already have one)

Create a new repository (I recommend picking a name that is easy to remember)

Add two files to your repository.

    autovlc.desktop
    add your video of choice but make sure it is named Video.mp4

Now you need to edit the two files, where it says "YOUR ______ HERE" you will replace the data with what you have

Now run the main.py file on your desktop and enjoy :)
